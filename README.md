# NLP_examples

 The notebook loads and inspects the texts in our corpus, sets up feature extraction, classifies our texts and evaluates our text classification model. 
 We will need to jump around the notebook to change settings and rerun the classification to find good settings for feature extraction and to evaluate our model.

 Each time we change settings, we will need to rerun the cells that create the pipeline and does the classification.

 The notebook also covers:
 Feature selection using SelectKBest
 and Automating parameter tuning using GridSearchCV

We also investigate lexicon-based sentiment analysis with Vader (‘Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning’). Vader is open source software. https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment
